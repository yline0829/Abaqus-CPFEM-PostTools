**Selective post-processing for large Abaqus ODB files.** Cross-platform tools for **Abaqus/CPFEM**, focused on selective ODB extraction, ParaView visualization, grain-resolved field analysis, GND evolution, tribological history data, and PEEQCP reconstruction.

> This project is independent of Dassault Systèmes. Abaqus is required to read/write ODB files; no Abaqus libraries or binaries are distributed here.

## Download

For most users, the recommended entry point is the **latest GitHub Release**:

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/yline0829/ODB2VTU-S/releases/latest)**

Available packages currently include (the existing v0.1.0 assets retain their original file names; future releases will use the ODB2VTU-S naming):

- **Windows — ODB2VTU-S Exporter**
- **Windows — ODB2VTU-S CPFEM Postprocessor**
- **Linux — Combined Tools**

The repository itself is the maintainable source tree; packaged ZIP files are distributed through **Releases**.

## Overview

The toolkit currently contains two complementary applications. The **S** in **ODB2VTU-S** stands for **Selective**, emphasizing selective access to large ODB databases:

| Application | Main purpose |
|---|---|
| **ODB2VTU-S Exporter** | Large-ODB selective ODB → VTU/PVD export, arbitrary Step/Frame field comparison, ParaView-ready fields, GrainID, Initial IPF, Mises, GND differences, grain-level extrema, and History/Curve data |
| **ODB2VTU-S CPFEM Postprocessor** | RP history extraction and frame-by-frame PEEQCP reconstruction/write-back using a physically matched StepTime sampling schedule |

## Key capabilities

### Selective ODB → VTU/PVD instead of full-database conversion

ODB2VTU-S Exporter is designed for large Abaqus ODB files. Users can select the **instance, grain/element region, Step, Frame, and Field Output** that are actually needed, then export only those states to ParaView-compatible VTU/PVD files. This avoids converting an entire multi-GB or multi-hundred-GB ODB when only a small set of physical states is required.

### Arbitrary Step/Frame time-series construction

A ParaView time series can be assembled from **arbitrary Step/Frame combinations**, not only consecutive frames. Multiple Steps can be selected together and specific frames can be added to the export schedule, which is useful for comparing equivalent physical positions across repeated friction cycles.

### Generic SDV / scalar-field difference comparison

For scalar element fields, including user-defined **SDV variables**, the exporter can calculate a target-reference difference between arbitrary stored states:

```text
DELTA_Field = Field(target Step/Frame) - Field(reference Step/Frame)
```

The reference Step and reference Frame are user-selectable. This makes it possible to compare, for example, `SDV29`, `SDV66`, `SDV104`, or another scalar element variable between selected loading/friction states and visualize the resulting difference directly in ParaView.

### Grain-aware post-processing

The toolkit reconstructs `GrainID`, supports an `<All Grains>` virtual region, correlates field extrema with grains, ranks Top-N grains, and can export only the selected extreme grains so unrelated grains are completely absent from the ParaView geometry.

### CPFEM-derived fields beyond native Abaqus output

Current model-specific derived capabilities include **Mises stress**, **Initial HCP-Ti IPF**, **18-slip-system GND evolution**, sliding-reference GND increments, and reconstructed **PEEQCP** from `Fp = SDV1–SDV9`.

### Physically matched sampling for cyclic friction

For PEEQCP comparison, the postprocessor traverses all stored frames for accumulation while saving:
- indentation/normal loading: first + last frame
- each sliding cycle: **T0 / T25 / T50 / T75 / T100 by StepTime**

If a target time is not stored exactly, the nearest actual ODB frame is selected.

> Note: the current generic field-comparison feature is a **stored-frame difference**, not continuous temporal interpolation between two frames. True time interpolation of arbitrary fields can be added as a future feature.

## Screenshots

### 1. ODB2VTU-S Exporter

Select an ODB, instance, grain region, analysis steps, frames, and output variables. Multi-step ParaView time-series export supports arbitrary Step/Frame states without converting the entire ODB.

### 2. ODB2VTU-S CPFEM Postprocessor

The CPFEM utility handles RP history data and PEEQCP reconstruction. PEEQCP is accumulated through all stored frames while selected physical states are retained for comparison and optional write-back.

### 3. ParaView — reconstructed PEEQCP

Exported PVD/VTU data can be opened directly in ParaView. The example below shows the reconstructed PEEQCP field in a friction/CPFEM model.

### 4. ParaView — initial crystallographic orientation

ODB2VTU-S Exporter can reconstruct the initial grain orientation from per-grain material Euler angles in the INP and export an HCP-Ti IPF-related field for ParaView visualization.

## Requirements

- A licensed Abaqus installation providing `odbAccess`
- An Abaqus command such as `abaqus` or `abq2024`
- ParaView for VTU/PVD visualization
- Windows: Windows PowerShell / WPF
- Linux GUI: Python 3 + Tkinter

For containerized Abaqus on Linux, set the GUI's **Abaqus command** to the full prefix, for example:

```bash
singularity exec /path/to/abaqus2024.sif /opt/run_abaqus.sh
```

The application appends `python <backend.py> ...` automatically.

## Important model assumptions

Some CPFEM-derived functions are model-specific. In particular, the current GND mapping assumes:

- `SDV11–SDV28` are the 18 slip-system GND densities
- `gnd_field.dat` column 1 is Abaqus element label
- columns 2–10 are nine initial GND/Burgers-direction densities
- each direction is split equally between its paired slip systems

See [docs/gnd_mapping.md](docs/gnd_mapping.md) before using the GND tools with another UMAT.

PEEQCP reconstruction assumes `SDV1–SDV9` contain `Fp` in the documented Fortran column-major mapping. See [docs/peeqcp.md](docs/peeqcp.md).

## Installation

- [Windows](docs/install-windows.md)
- [Linux](docs/install-linux.md)

For normal users, downloading a packaged asset from **Releases** is recommended.

## Build release packages

## Development status

This is the first public source release (`v0.1.0`). The project grew from an internal research post-processing workflow and is being generalized incrementally. Please report model/version compatibility issues through GitHub Issues.
